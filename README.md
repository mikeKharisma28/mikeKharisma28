### Hi there 👋

I am Michael, working as full time System Analyst in an Indonesian IT company. I also code in my free time and will always continue learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET Core and Java Spring Backend
- 🔭 I’m currently working Audit System and Master Plan Overhaul System using .NET 8.
- 🔭 I’m also working on Procurement backend system and (possibly) Procurement web, as my mini project and to sharpen my skill in Java development.
